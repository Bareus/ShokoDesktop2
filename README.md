# Shoko Desktop 2
Shoko Desktop 2 is the successor to Shoko Desktop, our anime management program.

Unlike the original Desktop which was designed using C# and WPF, Desktop 2 is being designed using the [Electron Framework](https://electron.atom.io/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) giving us more control and freedom over the design and functions of Shoko Desktop 2 then allowed by WPF.

The main goal of Shoko Desktop 2 is to provide our users with a fast, responsive and advanced anime management system. One of the big changes in Shoko Desktop 2 will be a robust plugin  system and theme support allowing devs to customize Shoko  to fit their needs.

# Development Phase: ALPHA
Shoko Desktop 2 is currently in **Alpha** phase of development. This means bugs, program crashing and unintended behavior is **normal** and **expected**.  Please note, your collection **will not** get corrupted or deleted by trying Shoko Desktop 2. At the moment, Shoko Desktop 2 is only able to read from your collection, not write to it.
